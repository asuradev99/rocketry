# CP2-Project
Because I am going to do a Computer Programming Internal Assessment I need to meet with a client first before I decide what my project will be. 

## Possible Ideas
### Physics simulator 
- this could be used to assist another science teacher's lessons. 
### Business Website 
- this could be to help one of my family's friends with a non-profit organization they run.
### Cellular Automata Simulator
- an idea I've been interested in for awhile, but is not likely to be wanted by a client.
### An Educational videogame
- Perhaps an educational videogame that teaches people math, english, etc.?
